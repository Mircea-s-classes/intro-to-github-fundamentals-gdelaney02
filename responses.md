## Garrett Delaney's Responses

* I did not learn much from this assignment as I have been using git/github for many years throughout undergrad. I actually started learning and using it in my high school CS class. I also used it extensively at my internship this past summer.
* Something I did learn was about how to create a github profile README. I never knew how to do that.
